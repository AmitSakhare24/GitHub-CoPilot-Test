# QA-with-GitHub-CoPilot
This repository contains the code base project that we test in the videos series, as well as some of the solution code.

There are 2 projects.  One for the simple JUnit lesson, and then another for the Mockito lesson.  

Simply click the "code" button in the upper corner and if you are comfortable with git, you can clone the repository.  Otherwise, download as a zip.  

We'll need to then open each folder seperately to view as individual projects.  More on how to do this in the video series paired.
