# QA-with-GitHub-CoPilot
This repository contains the code base project that we test in the videos series, as well as some of the solution code.

There are 3 projects.  One for the simple JUnit lesson, another for the Mockito lesson, and finally one for Cucumber. 

The second project with Mockito will also be used to demonstrate some Cucumber Automation testing on the Spring Boot API contained within.

Simply click the "code" button in the upper corner and if you are comfortable with git, you can clone the repository.  Otherwise, download as a zip.  

We'll need to then open each folder seperately to view as individual projects.  More on how to do this in the video series paired.

The last project "Cucumber Java" is created by and credited to YouTube Channel, "Automation Step By Step", and YouTube Author, "Raghav Pal". Check out the link here for the full video playlist on creating this project from scratch, as it is a good hands-on refresher if you are not strong in Cucumber.
