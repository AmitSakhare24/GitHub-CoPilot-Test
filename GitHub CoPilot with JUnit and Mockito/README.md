<p>This exercise is <b>OPTIONAL</b>, but recommended you try it at one point before we reach our final project in the course. It will be good practice and help you understand how to do testing in the service layer. </p>

<p>For this exercise, you will be completing the <code>BookServiceTest</code> file located within <code>src/test/java</code>. It has already been setup with the starting annotations for Mockito, but does not currently have any of the test methods implemented. Go through and read through the comments on each test method to understand what you need to test. </p>
