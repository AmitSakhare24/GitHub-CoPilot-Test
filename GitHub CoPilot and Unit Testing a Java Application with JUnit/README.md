<h2>DOWNLOADING REPOSITORY ON ECLIPSE</h2>

<p>Unlike previous Java homeworks, this one is just a regular Java project (like the ones we use in class). Please follow these instructions if you are opening it on Eclipse: </p>

1. Clone the project locally (you should already be familiar how to do this)
2. On Eclipse, select <b>File</b> --> <b>Import</b>
3. Under the <b>General</b> folder, look for and select the option <b>Existing Projects into Workspace</b> (if you can't find it, use the search box at the top of the window)
4. Click <b>Browse</b> and locate your project, then click <b>Finish</b>

<p>If you are getting errors in your code, double check to see if you have added the JUnit library to the project. It is <b>not part of the default system library, so you'll need to follow these instructions to add it</b>:</p>

1. Right click on your project
2. Select <b>Build Path</b> --> <b>Add Libraries</b>
3. Select the <b>JUnit</b> option then click <b>Next</b>
4. Where you see <b>JUnit Library Version</b> select <b>JUnit 5</b> from the drop down
5. Click <b>Finish</b>
6. You should the the library pop up under your project folder in the package explorer
